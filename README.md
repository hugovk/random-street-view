random street view
==================

Command-line Python 3 script to get a number of Street View images from random locations in a given country.

Random (lat, lon) co-ordinates are generated from the country's border's bounding box, then checked to make sure they're within the actual borders. The corresponding Street View image downloaded. Often there is no imagery for the location, so if the size of the image matches that of the default "no imagery" thumbnail, it's deleted. Repeat until required number of images have been fetched.
